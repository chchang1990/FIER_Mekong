Here are the training materials that were used for the NASA SERVIR-SEA Project Training to the stakeholders in the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC) in July 2023.
We demonstrated how the FIER-Mekong framework was built, and its capability of quickly generating inundation forecasts covering the entire Lower Mekong Floodplains. 
We then utilized the Floodwater Depth Estimation Tool (Peter et al., 2020) with our forecasted inundation extents and DEM as inputs to generate forecasted inundation depth maps.
Finally, by piling up consecutive forecasted inundation depths with 1 to 20-day lead times, we estimated the potential flood-induced rice damage in the next 20 days.
