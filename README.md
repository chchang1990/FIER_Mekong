Forecasting Inundation Extents using REOF analysis (FIER) in the Mekong River Floodplains (FIER-Mekong) and its application in forecasting flood-induced rice damages.

We have also developed an easy to use <a href="https://fier-mekong.streamlit.app/">FIER-Mekong WebApp</a>, which operationally generates up to 18-day lead times of inundation forecasts

Here are the training materials that were used for the NASA SERVIR-SEA Project Training to the stakeholders in the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC) in July 2023.

We demonstrated how the FIER-Mekong framework was built, and its capability of quickly generating inundation forecasts covering the entire Lower Mekong Floodplains. 

We then utilized the Floodwater Depth Estimation Tool (Peter et al., 2020) with our forecasted inundation extents and DEM as inputs to generate forecasted inundation depth maps.

Finally, by piling up several lead days of consecutive forecasted inundation depths, we estimated the potential upcoming flood-induced rice damage maps.
